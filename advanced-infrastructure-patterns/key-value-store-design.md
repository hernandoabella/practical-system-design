Designing a Key-Value Store
“At its core, a Key-Value store is the simplest database abstraction — but scaling it globally with high availability? That’s where the real challenge begins.”

A Key-Value Store is a type of NoSQL database that stores data as pairs of keys and values, optimized for fast access, simplicity, and scalability.

🔑 What Is a Key-Value Store?
A key is a unique identifier (like a string or number), and the value can be any data blob: JSON, binary, strings, objects, etc.

🧠 Real-World Examples
Product	Use Case Examples
Redis	In-memory cache, real-time counters
DynamoDB	Global serverless backend, IoT, gaming
RocksDB	Embedded persistent KV store
LevelDB	Chrome's local data store
Memcached	Lightweight in-memory caching

📦 Core Requirements
Feature	Needed For…
Get/Put/Delete	Basic KV operations
Persistence	Data should survive crashes
Scalability	Handle massive key space (sharding, replication)
Low latency	Serve requests in microseconds
TTL support	Auto-expire keys (caching use cases)
Concurrency safe	Handle high write/read concurrency
Backup & restore	Disaster recovery

API Layer: Exposes REST/gRPC endpoints: GET, PUT, DELETE

Storage Nodes: Store partitions/shards of key-space

Shard Manager: Uses consistent hashing to route keys

PUT /kv/user:123  → {"name": "Alice"}
GET /kv/user:123  → {"name": "Alice"}
DELETE /kv/user:123
⚙️ Key Features to Design
1. Sharding (Horizontal Partitioning)
Split keys across nodes using consistent hashing

Each node stores a range of keys (e.g., hash(key) % N)

Allows seamless horizontal scaling

2. Replication
Replicate each shard across multiple nodes (e.g., 3 replicas)

Use leader-follower model for strong consistency

Follower can serve reads for read-heavy use cases

3. Persistence
Use append-only log or LSM tree for durability

Write data to disk on every write (WAL)

Periodically merge segments (compaction)

4. TTL / Expiration
Store a timestamp with each key

Run a background sweeper or use lazy expiration (on access)

5. Concurrency Control
Use lock-free data structures or mutex per key-space partition

Optionally support transactions (e.g., via optimistic locking)

🚨 Failure Handling
Failure Type	Mitigation Strategy
Node crash	Use replica for failover
Network partition	Apply quorum-based reads/writes
Disk full	Monitor metrics, alert, auto-scale
Data loss	Backup to cloud storage regularly

🧪 Sample GET/PUT Flow

Editar
1. Client calls PUT /kv/user:123
2. API hashes key to Node2
3. Node2 writes to WAL + memory
4. Node2 syncs to replicas
5. Client receives 200 OK
🔐 Security & Access Control
Optional authentication tokens

IP whitelisting or firewall policies

Namespace isolation if multi-tenant

🔍 Monitoring & Metrics
QPS (Queries Per Second)

Read/write latency

Cache hit/miss ratio (if layered with caching)

Disk usage

Replica lag

💬 What to Say in Interviews
“I’d use consistent hashing to shard keys and store them on multiple replicas using a quorum-based write model. I’d ensure durability with an append-only log and support expiration with TTL metadata.”

“We can prioritize low latency by keeping hot keys in-memory and optimizing compaction strategies. Monitoring and scaling would be handled through auto-metrics and rebalancing.”

📘 Summary
Feature	Approach
Sharding	Consistent hashing
Replication	Leader-follower, 3-node quorum
Persistence	WAL + LSM Tree
Expiry	TTL metadata + sweeper
Query API	REST or gRPC
Scaling	Add nodes, rebalance shards
Real-world Example	Redis, DynamoDB, RocksDB
