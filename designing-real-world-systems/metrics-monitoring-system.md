Designing a Metrics Monitoring System
Goal: Collect, store, query, and visualize metrics for infrastructure, applications, and business logic.

✅ Functional Requirements
Core Features:
Ingest time-series metrics (e.g., CPU usage, QPS, error rates)

Store metrics efficiently over time

Support queries with filters, aggregations

Visualize metrics in dashboards

Trigger alerts based on thresholds

Support multi-tenant use (if SaaS)

🧪 Examples of Metrics
Metric	Example
Infrastructure metrics	CPU, memory, disk I/O, network
Application metrics	API latency, request count
Custom/business metrics	Orders per minute, revenue/hour
Error metrics	5xx rate, failed logins

🚫 Non-Functional Requirements
Low ingestion latency (real-time or near-real-time)

High write throughput (millions of datapoints/sec)

Efficient time-series storage (compression, TTL)

Query efficiency (aggregation, filtering)

High availability and durability

Support for long-term retention (tiered storage)

🛠️ Key Components
1. Metrics Collectors / Agents
Push-based: Agents send metrics (e.g., StatsD, FluentD)

Pull-based: System scrapes endpoints (e.g., Prometheus)

Example metric:

plaintext
Copiar
Editar
http_requests_total{method="GET", status="200"}  108
2. Ingestion Layer
Validates, deduplicates, batches incoming metrics

Applies tags/labels for filtering and aggregation

Supports multi-tenant token-based access control

3. Time-Series Database (TSDB)
Stores data with a timestamp

Common TSDBs: Prometheus, InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, M3DB

Techniques used:

Write-ahead log (WAL)

Compaction & compression

Downsampling for long-term storage

Schema Example:

plaintext
Copiar
Editar
timestamp | metric_name         | value | labels (JSONB)
---------------------------------------------------------
1623451212 | cpu_usage_percent   | 73.5  | {"host":"A", "region":"us-east"}
4. Query Engine
Supports queries like:

promQL
Copiar
Editar
rate(http_requests_total[5m]) by (status)
Aggregations: sum, avg, rate, max, min

Filtering: by time range, labels

Grouping: by tags like host, region, service

5. Visualization (Grafana)
Custom dashboards

Multi-datasource support

Alert thresholds and annotations

6. Alerting System
Define rules like:

yaml
Copiar
Editar
if: rate(5xx_errors_total[1m]) > 0.05
then: send alert to Slack/Email/On-call
Deduplication, silencing, grouping

Tools: Alertmanager, PagerDuty, Opsgenie

⚙️ Scaling & Optimization
Challenge	Solution
High ingestion rate	Batching + parallel ingestion nodes
Long-term storage	Downsampling, tiered cold storage (S3)
Label explosion	Cardinality management
Query latency	Indexing, pre-aggregation
Multi-tenant setup	Isolate via tokens or namespaces

🔐 Security Considerations
Token-based API access

HTTPS encryption

Audit logs for dashboard & alert changes

🧠 Interview Soundbite
“I’d design a pull-based metrics system using Prometheus to scrape metrics from exporters. For high throughput and scalability, I’d use sharded TSDB nodes and batch writes. For query and visualization, Grafana would connect via PromQL. Alerts would be routed using Prometheus Alertmanager and integrated with on-call tools.”

✅ Summary Table
Component	Example Tech	Responsibility
Agent	StatsD, Node Exporter	Collect metrics
Ingestion	Prometheus, FluentD	Validate, batch, send to TSDB
Storage (TSDB)	Prometheus, InfluxDB	Store & compact time-series
Visualization	Grafana	Dashboards, graphs
Alerting	Alertmanager	Thresholds, notifications

📦 Bonus Add-ons
Correlate metrics with logs/traces (OpenTelemetry)

Auto-discovery for new services/instances

Anomaly detection using ML models

Heatmaps, histograms, and percentile visualizations
