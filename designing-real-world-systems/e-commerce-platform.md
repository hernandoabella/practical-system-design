Designing an E-Commerce Platform
(Products, Cart, Orders)

Think Amazon or Shopify. A scalable e-commerce system must support millions of users browsing, searching, adding to cart, checking out, and managing orders — all while remaining fast, reliable, and secure.

🧾 Functional Requirements
✅ Core Features
Product catalog (categories, filters, search)

Shopping cart (session-based or persistent)

User authentication and profiles

Checkout and order processing

Inventory management

Payment gateway integration

Order history and tracking

Discounts, coupons, taxes

🚫 Non-Functional Requirements
High availability

Scalability (especially during sales)

Low-latency search & cart actions

Secure payments and data privacy

🎯 System Goals
Property	Target
Availability	99.99%
Scalability	Handle millions of users and flash-sale traffic
Latency	< 200ms for browsing & search
Consistency	Strong for orders, eventual for product listings
Durability	Orders and payments must not be lost

🧰 Key Components
1. Product Catalog
Stores item name, price, stock, description, tags

Indexed for search (Elasticsearch, Meilisearch)

Separate service for product updates (admin portal)

json
Copiar
Editar
{
  "product_id": "abc123",
  "name": "Wireless Headphones",
  "price": 59.99,
  "category": "Electronics",
  "tags": ["audio", "wireless", "bluetooth"],
  "stock": 120
}
2. Cart Service
Session-based cart for guests (cookie, token)

Persistent cart for logged-in users (DB or Redis)

Stored in Redis for speed

json
Copiar
Editar
{
  "user_id": "u456",
  "items": [
    { "product_id": "abc123", "qty": 2 },
    { "product_id": "def456", "qty": 1 }
  ]
}
📝 Redis used for quick reads/writes and session expiry.

3. Checkout & Order Service
Validates cart, locks inventory

Calculates total (taxes, shipping, discounts)

Initiates payment with external gateway

Stores order in SQL DB (strong consistency)

Order Schema Example:

sql
Copiar
Editar
orders(order_id, user_id, total_amount, status, created_at)
order_items(order_id, product_id, qty, price)
4. Inventory Management
Lock stock during checkout

Deduct on payment success

Use version numbers or atomic operations to avoid race conditions

5. Payment Gateway Integration
Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay, etc.

Webhook system to listen for payment status

Retry logic and idempotency on payment events

6. Search System
Full-text search over product catalog

Auto-suggestions and filters

Elasticsearch recommended

📊 Database Choices
Component	DB Choice
Product Catalog	NoSQL (MongoDB) or SQL
Cart	Redis (in-memory)
Orders	PostgreSQL, MySQL
Search	Elasticsearch
Payments	External + SQL fallback

📦 Example API Endpoints
http
Copiar
Editar
GET /products?category=electronics
POST /cart/add
POST /checkout
POST /payment/confirm
GET /orders/:id
🔄 Workflow: Placing an Order
User adds items to cart

Cart is retrieved and validated

Inventory is locked

User pays → external payment gateway

Webhook confirms payment

Inventory updated, order confirmed

Confirmation email sent

🛡️ Security Considerations
Encrypt all sensitive data (SSL, AES for PII)

Use tokenized payments (Stripe handles card info)

Rate limit cart/order endpoints

Use captchas and session validation

🔧 Scalability & Optimizations
Challenge	Solution
High traffic	CDN + Load balancers
Cart updates	Redis for quick writes
Payment latency	Async webhook listener
Flash sale inventory	Atomic decrement + locks
Hot product reads	Cache top products in Redis/CDN

📈 Monitoring
Checkout success/failure rate

Cart abandonment rate

Order fulfillment latency

Inventory mismatch alerts

Payment webhook reliability

🎙️ What to Say in Interviews
“I would split the platform into microservices: product catalog, cart, order processing, and payment. Carts are session-based and stored in Redis. Orders go through a payment gateway, and I use webhooks for confirmation. Inventory is updated transactionally to prevent overselling during high load.”

✅ Summary Table
Component	Design Choices
Product Catalog	NoSQL with Elastic search
Cart	Redis + session tokens
Orders	SQL (Postgres) with transactional writes
Payments	Stripe + webhook listener
Inventory	Lock on checkout, update on payment success
Scaling Strategy	Caching, async queueing, sharding at services
