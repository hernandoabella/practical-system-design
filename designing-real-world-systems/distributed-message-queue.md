Designing a Distributed Message Queue
Example systems: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS, Pulsar

A Distributed Message Queue ensures decoupled communication between services, enabling asynchronous, reliable, and scalable data processing across distributed systems.

✅ Functional Requirements
Publish & subscribe to messages

Message delivery guarantees (at-most-once, at-least-once, exactly-once)

Persistent message storage (durability)

Topic-based or queue-based models

Consumer groups for scaling processing

Retention, retry, and dead-letter queues

🚫 Non-Functional Requirements
High availability and fault tolerance

Low latency

Horizontal scalability

Message ordering (optional or guaranteed per partition)

Security: Auth, ACLs, encryption

🔧 Use Cases
Event-driven architectures

Logging pipelines (ELK, CloudWatch)

Metrics collection and aggregation

Notifications (email, SMS, push)

Streaming data for analytics or ML

Decoupling microservices (order processing, billing)

🧠 Key Concepts
1. Producer
Sends messages to the queue or topic.

2. Broker(s)
Receives, stores, and routes messages. Multiple brokers form a cluster.

3. Consumer(s)
Fetch messages from queues/topics for processing.

4. Topics & Partitions
Messages grouped by topics

Each topic is divided into partitions for scalability

plaintext
Copiar
Editar
Topic: orders
 ├── Partition 0 → Broker A
 ├── Partition 1 → Broker B
 └── Partition 2 → Broker C
5. Offsets
Each message in a partition has a unique offset. Consumers track these to resume processing.

🛠️ Delivery Guarantees
Mode	Description	Use Case
At most once	Message may be lost, but never duplicated	Non-critical logs
At least once	Guaranteed delivery, may deliver duplicates	Orders, payments (with idempotency)
Exactly once	Guaranteed once-only delivery (hard to achieve)	Financial transactions

Kafka offers at-least-once by default, and exactly-once with extra config (EOS).

🔁 Message Retention & Replay
Messages can be retained for hours/days (Kafka)

Consumers can replay messages using stored offsets

Useful for debugging, auditing, re-processing

⚙️ Scaling
Component	Scaling Strategy
Producers	Horizontal scaling, batching
Brokers	Partition sharding across nodes
Consumers	Consumer groups (each gets 1 partition)

💥 Failure Handling
Broker crash → replicate partitions (Kafka's ISR replicas)

Message fail → move to Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

Consumer crash → resume from stored offset

Retry strategy → exponential backoff with cap

🔐 Security & Access Control
TLS encryption

SASL or IAM-based authentication

Topic-level ACLs

Audit logging

🗂️ Database Schema (If Needed)
Mostly a log-based file system, but if using DB-backed queue:

sql
Copiar
Editar
messages(id, topic, partition, offset, payload, created_at)

consumers(id, group_id, topic, offset)

dead_letter_queue(id, original_message_id, reason)
🧠 Interview Soundbite
“I’d use a partitioned log-based queue like Kafka to allow horizontal scaling of producers and consumers. Each partition acts as an ordered append-only log. For resilience, I’d replicate partitions across brokers. To prevent message loss or duplication, I’d use idempotent consumers and commit offsets only after successful processing.”

✅ Summary Table
Feature	Common Design Choices
Queue Type	Kafka (topic-log), RabbitMQ (queue-based)
Scaling	Partitioning + consumer groups
Storage	Persistent log-based (Kafka)
Delivery Guarantees	At-least-once / Exactly-once
Fault Tolerance	Broker replication, DLQ
