Designing Google Maps-like System
(Map rendering, location search, directions, traffic, and more)

Designing a Google Maps-like system involves handling map rendering, geospatial search, real-time data, and routing at a massive, global scale.

🧾 Functional Requirements
✅ Core Features
Show detailed interactive maps (zoom, scroll, pan)

Search for places (POIs, addresses, coordinates)

Get driving, walking, and public transport directions

Show real-time traffic conditions

Show user’s current location

🚫 Non-Functional Requirements
Low latency (<200ms interaction response)

Support billions of map tiles, locations, and users

Global scalability

Real-time updates

🎯 System Goals
Property	Goal
Latency	< 200ms for tile load / search
Scale	Global, multi-billion queries/month
Accuracy	Meter-level location precision
Availability	99.999% (mission-critical system)
Data Updates	Near real-time for traffic/location

🧩 Key Components
1. 🧱 Map Tiles & Rendering
World map is broken into tiles at multiple zoom levels.

Each tile is an image (raster) or vector format (Mapbox, Google uses vector tiles).

Tiles are cached aggressively at CDNs or edge servers.

Tile Path Format:

bash
Copiar
Editar
/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf  ← z = zoom, x/y = coordinates
Storage:

Pre-render tiles and store on CDN (Cloudfront, Akamai)

Use quadtrees or R-tree indexing to manage coordinates

2. 🔍 Geocoding & Reverse Geocoding
Geocoding: Address → Coordinates

Reverse Geocoding: Coordinates → Address

Use:

Global address databases (OpenStreetMap, proprietary)

Index with ElasticSearch or Lucene

3. 📍 Location Search
Autocomplete as you type (cities, POIs)

Indexed using search engine (Elasticsearch)

Rank by proximity, popularity, relevance

Include categories: restaurants, banks, gas stations

4. 🧭 Routing Engine
Calculates optimal routes between two or more locations

Input: start, destination, mode (driving, walking, transit)

Algorithms:

Dijkstra (basic)

A Search* (uses heuristic distance)

Contraction Hierarchies / CH (used for fast routing)

Real systems use graph optimizations + precomputation.

5. 🚦 Real-Time Traffic & Events
Crowdsourced GPS from apps + official data feeds (e.g. Waze, cities)

Events: accidents, closures, weather

Stored in a real-time feed (Kafka)

Feed updates influence route weights dynamically

6. 🛰️ Location Services
Fetch and display user's location using GPS or IP-based geolocation

Update periodically or via motion sensors

📦 Data Models
sql
Copiar
Editar
-- POI (Point of Interest)
places(id, name, lat, lon, type, address)

-- Roads Graph
roads(id, start_node, end_node, distance, speed_limit)

-- Traffic Conditions
road_traffic(road_id, timestamp, congestion_level, delay_ms)
⚙️ Scaling Techniques
Challenge	Solution
Billions of tile requests	CDN cache, edge computing
Real-time traffic updates	Kafka + in-memory routing update
Massive POI search	Sharded search index (e.g. Elasticsearch)
Frequent GPS uploads	Batch + aggregation

🔐 Security & Privacy
Opt-in location sharing

Obfuscate or fuzz real-time location data

Rate-limit geolocation APIs

GDPR-compliant storage and expiration

📊 Monitoring
Metric	Notes
Tile load latency	CDN hits/misses
Search query success	Relevance of results
Routing success rate	Did it return valid directions?
Traffic data ingestion rate	Delays in update

🧠 Interview Tips
“I’d store the base map as vector tiles, served through a CDN for fast access. For routing, I’d use precomputed contraction hierarchies and real-time weight updates via Kafka streams from GPS data. Geospatial search is powered by Elasticsearch with POI ranking by distance and popularity.”
