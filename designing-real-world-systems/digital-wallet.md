Designing a Digital Wallet System (e.g., Apple Pay, Venmo, Paytm)
A digital wallet allows users to store money, transfer funds, pay online, and track balances. The system must guarantee security, accuracy, and scale for millions of users and transactions.

🧾 Functional Requirements
✅ Core Features
Add funds (via card, bank, etc.)

Withdraw funds to bank accounts

Peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers

Merchant payments (QR code, payment link)

Transaction history & statements

KYC verification for compliance

🚫 Non-Functional Requirements
High reliability and availability

Low-latency P2P transfers

ACID guarantees for wallet balances

Regulatory compliance (KYC, AML)

Secure storage of user and payment data

🎯 System Goals
Metric	Target
Availability	99.99%
Consistency	Strong (wallets must stay accurate)
Latency (P2P)	< 100ms
Throughput	10K+ transactions/sec
Regulatory	PCI-DSS, KYC, AML-compliant

🗃️ Key Components
1. 🔐 Token Vault
Store sensitive payment methods (cards, bank accounts)

Tokenize for security and PCI-DSS compliance

2. 📓 Ledger Service (Double-Entry)
The core of the wallet system. Handles atomic transactions:

sql

Editar
debit(userA_wallet, 50)
credit(userB_wallet, 50)
Each transaction generates two immutable entries for audit:

Entry ID	Wallet ID	Amount	Type
101	A	-50	debit
102	B	+50	credit

3. 🔄 Wallet API Service
Exposes REST endpoints for:

/transfer, /deposit, /withdraw, /balance

Handles validation, rate-limiting, idempotency

4. ⚠️ Fraud Detection & Limits
Real-time engine flags suspicious transfers

Daily/monthly limits per user or merchant

Behavioral scoring (velocity, device mismatch)

5. 🧾 KYC & AML Integration
Identity verification (via third-party APIs like Trulioo, Onfido)

Monitor and flag suspicious behavior

6. 🏦 Bank & Card Integration
Deposits/withdrawals go through card and bank gateways (ACH, UPI, etc.)

Use async callbacks for transaction status

📊 Database Schema (Simplified)
sql
Copiar
Editar
users(id, name, email, kyc_status)

wallets(id, user_id, balance, currency)

ledger(id, wallet_id, amount, type, txn_id, created_at)

transactions(id, sender_id, receiver_id, amount, status)

payment_methods(id, user_id, token, method_type)
⚙️ Scaling & Performance Techniques
Challenge	Solution
Race conditions	Use locking or DB-level ACID isolation
Duplicate transfers	Use idempotency keys
Load on ledger writes	Batch and queue writes
KYC bottlenecks	Async processing & tiered limits
Frequent balance checks	Use cache + database fallback

🔐 Security & Compliance
PCI-DSS for handling card details (via vault/tokenization)

GDPR for data privacy

End-to-end encryption

OTP / MFA / biometric auth

HMAC/Webhook signing

🧠 What to Say in Interviews
“I’d keep wallet balances and transactions in an append-only double-entry ledger to ensure accuracy and auditability. To prevent race conditions, I’d use DB transactions or Redis locks per wallet. Sensitive data like card info would be tokenized and stored securely. Fraud prevention and compliance would be modular and async.”

✅ Summary Table
Feature	Approach
Fund storage	Wallet table + ledger
Secure card handling	Tokenization & PCI-compliant vault
Transfers	API layer + Ledger atomic writes
Fraud detection	Rule-based + ML engine
KYC	External service integration
Idempotency	Keys + Redis tracking
