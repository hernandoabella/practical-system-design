Designing a Stock Exchange System
A Stock Exchange System processes millions of trades per second, matches buyers and sellers in real-time, ensures fairness, and handles huge volumes of financial data with minimal latency.

✅ Functional Requirements
Place buy/sell orders (limit, market, stop)

Real-time order matching and execution

View order book (depth, price levels)

Cancel or modify orders

Track user portfolio and trade history

Broadcast price updates and ticker feeds

Support multiple trading instruments (stocks, ETFs)

🚫 Non-Functional Requirements
Ultra-low latency (< 10ms) for order matching

High throughput (millions of transactions/sec)

Strong consistency and durability of executed trades

100% uptime during trading hours

Regulatory compliance and auditability

🧱 Core Components
Component	Responsibility
Order Gateway	Entry point for user orders (API, mobile, web)
Order Book Service	Maintains live buy/sell orders per stock
Matching Engine	Core logic for order matching and execution
Trade Ledger	Stores finalized trades, immutable and auditable
Portfolio Service	Tracks user positions and balances
Market Data Broadcaster	Publishes ticker updates and market feeds
Risk & Compliance Engine	Validates rules, user balance, fraud detection
Admin Dashboard	Real-time system monitoring, halt/resume markets

🧮 Matching Engine Logic (Simplified)
Receive a buy/sell order

Check if matching order exists in the book

Match based on price-time priority

Execute trade, update both orders

Store trade in ledger and notify systems

Example Matching Rule (Price-Time Priority):

text
Copiar
Editar
Buy: $10 x 100 shares @ 9:01:01  
Sell: $10 x 100 shares @ 9:01:02  
→ Match occurs at $10, 100 shares executed
💡 Order Types
Order Type	Description
Market Order	Execute immediately at best available price
Limit Order	Buy/sell at a specific price or better
Stop Order	Trigger market order when threshold is crossed
IOC/FOK	Immediate or cancel / Fill or kill orders

🔐 Risk & Compliance
Pre-trade risk checks: sufficient funds, position limits

Post-trade validation: AML, suspicious trading patterns

Auditing logs: every order and action is tracked

Regulatory APIs (e.g., SEC, FINRA compliance)

⚡ Performance Optimizations
Layer	Technique
Order Matching	In-memory data structures (red-black tree)
Trade Recording	Append-only log + replication
Feed Broadcasting	WebSocket + Redis pub/sub + Kafka
Latency Control	Co-location of trading servers

🧠 Database Design (Simplified)
sql
Copiar
Editar
ORDERS(id, user_id, stock_symbol, type, price, quantity, status, created_at)

TRADES(id, buy_order_id, sell_order_id, price, quantity, executed_at)

PORTFOLIOS(user_id, stock_symbol, quantity, avg_price)

USERS(id, balance, margin, role)
🔁 Scaling Strategy
Shard order books by stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA)

Stateless matching engines per shard

Use Kafka for high-throughput trade/event streaming

Use time-series DB for historical analytics

Redis for live order books and hot data caching

🔊 Real-Time Market Feeds
WebSocket service streams:

Ticker prices

Market depth (Level 2 data)

Trade history

Throttled and batched to reduce bandwidth

CDN edge caching for public pricing info

⚖️ Trade-Offs
Trade-off	Consideration
Latency vs Accuracy	Market orders vs delayed confirmations
In-memory speed	Risk of crash unless backed by logs
High availability	Redundant matching nodes per shard
Scale vs Regulation	Must still log and comply with all trades

🧪 Interview Soundbite
“I’d design the exchange around a low-latency matching engine backed by in-memory order books and append-only trade logs. Orders are routed through an API gateway to ensure compliance checks before matching. Trade results are published via Kafka and streamed in real time. The system is sharded by stock symbol and supports high-throughput with a strict SLA.”
