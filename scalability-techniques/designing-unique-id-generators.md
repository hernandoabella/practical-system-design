Designing Unique ID Generators
“In distributed systems, even generating an ID can be a complex problem.”

Unique ID generation is critical for databases, event logs, URLs, user IDs, and more — especially in distributed architectures where collisions or ordering issues must be avoided.

🧠 Why Is Unique ID Generation a Challenge?
In small, monolithic systems, using something like AUTO_INCREMENT (SQL) or UUID() may be enough. But in distributed systems, we face challenges like:

Duplicate IDs (conflict)

Global ordering

Coordination overhead

Performance bottlenecks

✅ Requirements of a Good ID Generator
Requirement	Explanation
Uniqueness	No two IDs should be the same
Scalability	Should support high request rates
Orderable (optional)	Helps with time-based sorting (e.g., feeds)
Compact	IDs shouldn't be too long or heavy
Stateless	Avoid central bottlenecks if possible

🧰 Common ID Generation Techniques
1. Auto-Increment (Relational DB)
Simple, sequential

Good for single-node

❌ Not safe for distributed systems (risk of collisions)

2. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
Format: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000

Generated without a central server

❌ Long (128-bit), hard to sort or index

✅ Good for decentralized systems

3. Snowflake ID (Twitter-inspired)
A 64-bit ID that encodes:

pgsql
Copiar
Editar
| timestamp | datacenter ID | worker ID | sequence |
Time-ordered

Supports high throughput

No DB calls

Widely used (Twitter, Discord, Instagram)

Example:
text
Copiar
Editar
64 bits = 
[41 bits timestamp][10 bits node ID][12 bits sequence]
🛠 Libraries available in many languages:

Node.js: snowflake-id

Python: snowflake.connector, flake-idgen

Go: sonyflake

4. Database-Based Generator
Use a table with a current value and atomic INCREMENT

Can support batching (get 1000 IDs)

✅ Simple, safe

❌ Centralized, potential bottleneck

5. Segmented/Hi-Lo ID Generation
Allocate blocks of IDs to nodes (e.g., 1000–1999)

Nodes generate IDs locally until block exhausted

✅ Reduces contention

❌ Slight coordination needed for block allocation

6. KSUID / ULID / NanoID
Lexicographically sortable

Smaller than UUID

Encodes time + randomness

Better for modern apps (e.g., NanoID for URLs)

Type	Sortable	Compact	Decentralized
UUID	❌	❌	✅
ULID	✅	✅	✅
KSUID	✅	✅	✅
NanoID	❌	✅	✅

64-bit ID structure:

[ timestamp (41 bits) | data center (5) | worker (5) | sequence (12) ]

- Timestamp: in ms since custom epoch
- Data center/Worker: to distinguish nodes
- Sequence: rolling counter per ms
📊 Trade-Offs Comparison
Method	Ordered?	Global?	Decentralized?	Length	Suitable For
Auto-Increment	✅	❌	❌	Short	SQL, simple apps
UUID	❌	✅	✅	Long	Decentralized, offline
Snowflake	✅	✅	✅	Medium	Social feeds, messaging
ULID / KSUID	✅	✅	✅	Medium	Modern APIs, ordering
DB Segment (Hi-Lo)	✅	✅	Partial	Short	Medium-scale services

💬 What to Say in Interviews
“For high-scale distributed systems, I’d avoid centralized auto-increment IDs. Instead, I’d use a Snowflake-style ID to generate sortable, decentralized unique identifiers with minimal coordination.”

“If human readability and shorter size matter (like URLs), I’d consider NanoID or ULID.”

📘 Final Notes
❗ Never rely solely on client-generated IDs unless using strong guarantees (e.g., UUIDv4 or ULID)

✅ Test collision resistance and ordering with real load

🔒 Use cryptographic random generation if IDs are exposed publicly

🏁 Final Takeaway
“A good ID generator balances uniqueness, scalability, and simplicity. The right choice depends on your architecture — centralized or distributed, relational or NoSQL, user-facing or internal.”
