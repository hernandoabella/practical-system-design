Cost-Aware Architecture
Designing systems that are scalable and economically sustainable.

üß© Why It Matters
As your system scales to serve millions of users, costs can skyrocket if not intentionally controlled. Cost-aware architecture helps ensure:

üí∞ Lower cloud infrastructure bills

‚öñÔ∏è Better resource utilization

üìâ Predictable operational costs

üöÄ Sustainable growth at scale

üß± Key Cost Drivers in System Design
Component	Cost Factors
Compute (VMs, Lambda)	Instance type, idle time, over-provisioning
Storage (S3, EBS, DBs)	Hot vs cold data, versioning, snapshots
Networking (Data transfer)	Ingress/egress fees, cross-region traffic
Databases	Read/write IOPS, storage tiers, backups
CDNs	Cache misses, geographic spread
Third-party Services	APIs with metered usage or pricing tiers

üß† Design Strategies to Reduce Cost
1. Right-Sizing Infrastructure
Avoid overprovisioned VMs or large Kubernetes clusters

Use autoscaling based on CPU/memory thresholds

2. Leverage Serverless or Spot Instances
Use AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions for event-driven workloads

Use spot/preemptible instances for stateless workers

3. Tiered Storage
Hot data in Redis or SSD-backed DBs

Cold data in S3 Glacier or archival DB tables

4. Efficient Caching
Use CDNs (Cloudflare, CloudFront) to reduce origin load

Apply cache control headers wisely (TTL, versioning)

Cache at API Gateway level if possible

5. Database Optimization
Use read replicas for scaling reads instead of larger DBs

Use partitioning to isolate high-volume tables

Choose cost-effective DBs: e.g., PostgreSQL vs DynamoDB for certain workloads

6. Traffic Locality & CDN
Replicate data or services across regions to avoid cross-region data egress fees

Use edge caches to serve static and semi-dynamic content

7. Monitor Usage and Budgets
Use tools like:

AWS Cost Explorer / Budgets

GCP Billing Reports

Azure Cost Management

Set up budget alerts and enforce policies (e.g., Kubernetes resource quotas)

üõ†Ô∏è Example: Redesigning an Overpriced Image Hosting App
Before:

All images in S3 Standard

No CDN, each request hits origin

Python Flask app running on 5 large EC2s, 24/7

MongoDB Atlas paid tier

After (Optimized):

Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering

Add CloudFront CDN with cache control

Migrate to serverless (Lambda) with API Gateway

Use DynamoDB on-demand for metadata

Results: üí∏ 80% cost reduction

‚öñÔ∏è Common Tradeoffs
Option A	Option B	Consideration
Always-on compute (EC2)	Serverless (Lambda/FaaS)	Serverless is cheaper at low scale
Standard storage (S3)	Glacier / Coldline	Latency vs cost
Multi-region replication	Centralized infra	Redundancy vs cross-region costs
High availability + replicas	Single instance with failover	Uptime vs budget constraints
Proprietary third-party API	Build in-house	Build cost vs usage cost

üí¨ What to Say in an Interview
‚ÄúWhen designing large-scale systems, I always evaluate cost-impact early on. For example, caching with a CDN significantly reduces backend load and data transfer fees. I also favor serverless for infrequent compute tasks to avoid idle charges.‚Äù
