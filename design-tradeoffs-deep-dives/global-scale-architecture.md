Global-Scale Architecture
Designing systems for billions of users across continents.

🔍 What Is Global-Scale Architecture?
Global-scale architecture is the design and deployment of systems that can serve users around the world with low latency, high availability, and geo-resilience. These systems are built to handle:

🌐 Millions to billions of users

⏱️ Latency under 100ms globally

📉 Regional failures without downtime

🧩 Complex compliance (e.g. GDPR, data residency)

🧱 Core Building Blocks
Component	Role at Global Scale
CDN (Content Delivery Network)	Caches static content close to users
DNS Routing	Geolocation-based request routing
Global Load Balancers	Route requests across regions/clouds
Multi-region Databases	Sync data with latency and consistency trade-offs
Edge Compute	Run logic at the edge (e.g., Cloudflare Workers)
Failover Systems	Redirect traffic during regional failures
Infrastructure as Code	Automate deployments globally

🌍 Global Considerations
⚡ Latency
Use Anycast DNS + CDNs to serve content from nearest edge

Put read replicas near users

Prefer regional endpoints for APIs

🔐 Compliance & Data Residency
Store EU user data in EU (GDPR)

Use region-specific S3 buckets / DBs

Include geo-aware routing and isolation

☁️ Multi-Cloud Strategy
Deploy across AWS + GCP or Azure for redundancy

Use Cloudflare, Akamai, or Fastly to sit in front of multiple clouds

📉 Fault Tolerance
Health checks + auto-failover

Use active-active or active-passive region setups

Regularly simulate region failures (chaos testing)

🎯 Case Studies
Company	Strategy Summary
Netflix	Multi-region video CDN + control plane in AWS
Meta	Global edge + data centers optimized for locality
Dropbox	Data stored in specific regions based on user residency
Google	Global service mesh with traffic shaping + redundancy

💬 What to Say in an Interview
"When designing for global scale, I prioritize minimizing user-perceived latency using CDNs and edge compute. I use multi-region failover strategies and often isolate sensitive user data by geography to meet compliance needs like GDPR."

✅ Summary Table
Category	Key Solution
Latency	CDNs, edge compute, geo DNS
High Availability	Multi-region load balancers, auto failover
Compliance	Regional data storage, isolated tenants
Scalability	Distributed DBs, partitioning
DevOps	IaC, monitoring per region, automated tests
