 Web Servers & Reverse Proxies – Gatekeepers of the Web
"Before your backend processes a single request, your web server and reverse proxy have already shaped the experience."

These two components often work together as the first line of communication between users and your backend — managing routing, performance, and security.

🔍 1. What Is a Web Server?
A web server receives HTTP(S) requests from clients (browsers, mobile apps), processes them (or passes them along), and sends back a response — often static content or API responses.

📦 Key Functions
Function	Description
Serve static files	HTML, CSS, JS, images
Handle HTTP methods	GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
Manage connections	Handle concurrent users, keep-alive sessions
Redirect requests	e.g., HTTP to HTTPS, or legacy to new URLs
Apply headers	Cache-control, CORS, Content-Type

🛠️ Common Web Servers
Server	Strengths	Typical Use Case
Nginx	High concurrency, event-driven	Reverse proxy, static content
Apache	Mature, flexible modules	Enterprise setups, legacy support
Caddy	Auto TLS, minimal config	Dev-friendly, quick deployments
Node.js/Express	Programmatic, JS ecosystem	Custom backend logic

🔄 2. What Is a Reverse Proxy?
A reverse proxy is a gateway server that receives client requests and forwards them to appropriate backend servers. It hides the internal architecture and optimizes routing.

🔁 What It Does
Feature	Benefit
Load balancing	Distribute traffic to backend servers
SSL/TLS termination	Handle HTTPS before it reaches app servers
Caching	Reduce backend load for repeated requests
Compression (gzip/brotli)	Speed up data transfer
URL rewriting/routing	Direct specific paths to different microservices
Security filtering	Block bad requests, prevent DoS

🔗 Web Server vs Reverse Proxy
Feature	Web Server	Reverse Proxy
Client-facing?	Yes	Yes
Sends request to app?	Yes or serves static content	Yes — always forwards to backend
Does load balancing?	No	Yes
Caching support?	Limited (depends on config)	Strong, often built-in
SSL termination?	Sometimes	Yes, typically handled here

User → Nginx (Reverse Proxy)
     ↳ Static files (HTML/CSS/JS) ← served directly
     ↳ /api/* → App Server (Node.js, Flask, etc.)
     ↳ /images → CDN or another microservice
In many setups, a single tool like Nginx or Caddy acts as both a web server and a reverse proxy.

🧪 Real-World Use Case
E-commerce platform:

Nginx serves all static files (product images, CSS)

For /api/checkout, it forwards traffic to the payment service

SSL is terminated at Nginx

Response headers are compressed with Brotli

💬 What to Say in Interviews
“I’d place an Nginx reverse proxy in front of my backend services to handle SSL, routing, and caching. This offloads responsibilities from the app and allows horizontal scaling with ease.”

“For static content like JS and CSS, the web server can directly serve it, while dynamic requests hit the app layer via the reverse proxy.”

✅ Summary Table
Component	Purpose	Examples
Web Server	Serve static content, handle HTTP	Nginx, Apache, Caddy
Reverse Proxy	Route, secure, compress, and load-balance	Nginx, Envoy, HAProxy

🏁 Final Thought
"Your backend code is only as reachable as your front-facing layer allows. A smart setup of web servers and reverse proxies makes your system fast, secure, and scalable before a single line of logic runs."
