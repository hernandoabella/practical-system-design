Blue/Green & Canary Deployments
“Deploy with confidence. Rollback with ease.”

Modern deployment strategies aim to minimize downtime, reduce risk, and allow safe releases. Two of the most effective methods are Blue/Green and Canary deployments.

🧠 Why Use These Deployment Strategies?
Benefit	Description
✅ Zero-Downtime	Avoid disruptions for users during updates
🛡️ Safe Rollbacks	Quickly revert to stable versions
📊 Real-Time Monitoring	Measure system behavior with live traffic
🧪 Gradual Rollouts	Limit exposure to bugs by deploying to subsets first
🧰 Better Testing in Prod	Validate performance, stability, and feature behavior

🔷 Blue/Green Deployment
🔧 Concept
Run two identical environments:

Blue = currently live (production)

Green = new version to be tested

When green is verified, you switch traffic over.

     +----------+      +--------+      +----------+
User |          | ---> |  Blue  | ---> | Database |
     |          |      +--------+      +----------+

     New version deployed on Green
     Switch traffic after validation
✅ Use Cases
Full app version replacement

No dependency on gradual rollout

Easy rollback (switch back to Blue)

❗ Trade-Offs
Pro	Con
Simple to understand	Doubles infra during transition
Fast rollback	State/data sync can be tricky
Zero downtime	High resource cost

🟡 Canary Deployment
🐤 Concept
Release new version to a small subset of users, monitor behavior, and gradually increase traffic if healthy.

✅ Use Cases
Testing specific features in production

Reducing blast radius of potential bugs

Supporting feature flags

📈 Rollout Strategy
Time	% of Traffic to Canary
T0	5%
T1	25%
T2	50%
T3	100% (full release)

❗ Trade-Offs
Pro	Con
Low-risk and gradual	More complex automation
Easy performance monitoring	Slow rollout = delayed feedback
Real-world feedback loop	Requires granular observability

⚙️ Tooling for Deployments
Tool	Strategy Support	Notes
Kubernetes	Blue/Green, Canary	Via services, labels, Ingress, Istio
Istio/Linkerd	Canary routing, traffic shaping	Fine-grained control via policies
Spinnaker	All strategies	Powerful CI/CD platform
AWS CodeDeploy	Blue/Green, Canary	Works with Lambda, ECS, EC2

📋 Real-World Example: Blue/Green with Kubernetes
yaml

Editar
# Kubernetes Service routing to blue version
selector:
  app: my-app
  version: blue

# When green is ready
# Update service selector to version: green
💡 Best Practices
Practice	Why It's Important
Monitor KPIs (latency, errors)	Detect regressions immediately
Use feature flags	Decouple code deploy from feature release
Automate health checks	Trigger rollback if metrics degrade
Keep environments in sync	Avoid config drift between Blue/Green

🎙️ Interview Soundbite
“I typically prefer Canary deployments for critical systems where user experience matters. With proper monitoring and alerting, you can validate performance and gradually ramp up traffic. But for simpler apps, Blue/Green is a reliable fallback for zero-downtime deploys.”

✅ Summary
Feature	Blue/Green	Canary
Rollout Type	All at once	Gradual
Risk Level	Medium	Low
Rollback Ease	Very easy (switch)	Easy (reduce traffic)
Infra Overhead	High	Low to Medium
Monitoring Required	Minimal	Essential
Complexity	Low	Moderate to High
