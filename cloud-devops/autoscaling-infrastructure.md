Autoscaling Infrastructure
“Scale out when needed, scale in to save cost.”

Autoscaling is the backbone of elastic infrastructure—automatically adjusting resources (like servers or containers) in response to real-time load, ensuring performance, cost-efficiency, and resilience.

🔍 Why Autoscaling Matters
Benefit	Description
⚡ Performance	Handle traffic spikes without latency or errors
💸 Cost Efficiency	Avoid overprovisioning by scaling down unused resources
🛡️ Resilience	Replace failing instances automatically
🧪 Test in Production	Dynamic environments for load testing

🛠️ Types of Autoscaling
1. Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out/In)
Add/remove instances (e.g., VMs, containers).

Example: Add more pods in Kubernetes or EC2 instances in AWS.

[User Requests] → [Load Balancer] → [Instance 1, Instance 2, ... Instance N]
2. Vertical Scaling (Scale Up/Down)
Increase or decrease the resources (CPU/RAM) on a single machine.

Example: Upgrade an EC2 instance from t3.medium → m5.large.

⚠️ Vertical scaling is simpler but limited by hardware caps.

🔁 Triggers for Autoscaling
Metric	Trigger Example
🧠 CPU Utilization	Scale out if > 70% CPU for 5 mins
💽 Memory Usage	Scale in if memory < 40% for 10 mins
📩 Request Rate (QPS)	Scale based on incoming API calls/sec
📦 Queue Length	Increase workers if job queue exceeds 1000
📉 Custom Metrics	Latency, error rate, user sessions, etc.

spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:

      name: cpu
      target:

        averageUtilization: 70
🧠 Interview Tip
“In high-throughput services, I’d combine HPA (pods) with Cluster Autoscaler (nodes) for elasticity. To avoid flapping, I’d tune thresholds with a cool-down period and use Prometheus custom metrics for smarter scaling.”

📝 Summary Table
Feature	Description
Horizontal Scaling	Add/remove instances or containers
Vertical Scaling	Upgrade machine specs
Reactive Scaling	Based on usage metrics
Predictive Scaling	Based on historical patterns
Manual Scaling	Triggered by ops/devs
Serverless Scaling	Auto-handled by provider

✅ Best Practices
Use graceful shutdowns when scaling in

Set cooldown periods to avoid over-scaling

Monitor scaling latency (cold starts)

Use load testing to model peak behavior

Implement custom metrics (e.g., queue depth)

Don’t forget budget limits when autoscaling!
