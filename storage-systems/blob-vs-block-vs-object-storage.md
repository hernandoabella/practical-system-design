Blob vs Block vs Object Storage
“Not all storage is created equal. The best engineers don’t just store data — they store it intelligently.”

Choosing the right storage solution is critical in system design. Whether you're storing logs, images, backups, or databases — your system’s performance, scalability, and cost efficiency depend on picking the correct type.

🧠 Core Definitions
Type	Description
Block Storage	Data is divided into equal-sized blocks and stored individually. Used by OS.
File Storage	Data stored in a hierarchical file/folder structure. Like traditional disks.
Object Storage	Data stored as objects (blob + metadata + key) in a flat namespace.

In this module, we’ll focus on the most common for cloud-scale systems: Block vs Object vs Blob.

📦 Object Storage
Data stored as key-value pairs

Ideal for unstructured data: images, videos, backups

Each object contains:

Data (blob)

Metadata

Unique key (identifier)

🧪 Examples:
Amazon S3

Google Cloud Storage

Azure Blob Storage (acts like object storage)

✅ Best for:
User uploads

Log/archive storage

Static web assets

Media delivery via CDN

🔲 Block Storage
Data split into fixed-size blocks

Managed by the Operating System or Database Engine

Offers low latency and high IOPS

Lacks metadata or hierarchy

🧪 Examples:
AWS EBS

Azure Disk Storage

Google Persistent Disk

✅ Best for:
Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)

High-performance applications (e.g. virtual machines)

Enterprise-grade workloads (OLTP, transactional)

🧊 Blob Storage
“Blob” = Binary Large OBject

Term used by Azure but functionally equivalent to object storage

Also used as a concept in some NoSQL databases (e.g. storing PDFs in SQLite)

✅ Best for:
Media-heavy apps

Binary data stores

Azure-based data lakes

🔍 Comparison Table
Feature	Block Storage	Object Storage	Blob Storage (Azure)
Structure	Raw blocks	Objects (data + metadata)	Objects (Azure format)
Access Protocol	iSCSI, NFS	REST APIs, HTTP/S	REST APIs, Azure SDK
Performance	⚡ High IOPS	Moderate	Moderate
Use Case	Databases, VMs	Media, backups	Azure data lakes
Scalability	Limited to device	Virtually unlimited	Unlimited
File Management	None (OS-level)	Built-in with metadata	Built-in with metadata
Mountable?	Yes (like a disk)	No	No
Versioning	❌ No	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Examples	AWS EBS, GCP PD	AWS S3, GCP Storage	Azure Blob Storage

💬 What to Say in Interviews
“For structured data and high-speed access like OLTP databases, I’d use block storage (e.g., EBS). For scalable, low-cost file storage like media uploads or logs, I’d use object storage (e.g., S3).”

“In Azure, blob storage refers to object storage — they just use different terminology.”

⚠️ Real-World Considerations
Challenge	Solution
Slow reads in object store	Use CDN or cache layer (e.g., CloudFront)
No file hierarchy	Use prefixes in keys (e.g., "user/photos/")
Cost of high IOPS in block	Optimize DB queries, tune instance types

🎯 When to Use What?
Use Case	Best Fit
Serving media files (images, video)	Object / Blob
Hosting a database or file system	Block
Virtual machine disk	Block
Storing analytics logs	Object / Blob
Frequent updates to same file	Block
Big data pipelines (Azure)	Blob

🏁 Final Takeaway
“Object storage is your go-to for scalable, durable, unstructured data. Block storage is your weapon of choice for high-performance compute systems like databases or OS disks.”
