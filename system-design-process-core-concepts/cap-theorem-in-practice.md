CAP Theorem in Practice
“You can’t have it all. CAP forces you to choose your tradeoffs.”

The CAP Theorem, proposed by Eric Brewer, is a foundational principle in distributed system design. It states that in any distributed system, you can only guarantee two out of the following three:

Consistency

Availability

Partition Tolerance

⚖️ Definitions Recap
Term	Meaning
Consistency	Every read gets the most recent write (no stale data)
Availability	Every request gets a (non-error) response — even if it’s not the latest
Partition Tolerance	The system continues to operate despite network failures

📌 In real distributed systems, partition tolerance is a must — so you have to choose between consistency and availability.

🧪 Real-World Interpretations
Here’s how CAP plays out in practice across systems:

Scenario	Tradeoff Choice	Example System	Why?
Banking Transactions	CP	Traditional RDBMS (PostgreSQL)	Prioritize consistency for accurate records
Social Media Feed	AP	Cassandra, DynamoDB	Prefer availability (eventual consistency is OK)
Real-time Messaging	CA (mostly)	Redis (non-distributed)	Avoid partitions, optimize for low-latency and freshness
Global Shopping Cart	CP	Spanner	Accuracy > speed; tolerate brief unavailability
Product Search on E-commerce	AP	Elasticsearch	Best effort, fast results, eventually consistent

Availability —— Partition Tolerance
⚠️ In the presence of a partition, you must choose:

CP: Stop responding until you can ensure consistency

AP: Keep responding, even if it’s with stale data

🎯 Design Considerations
When choosing between CP and AP, ask:

Is the data critical (e.g., money, medical records)?

Can the system tolerate delay in updates?

Do users expect real-time accuracy?

Will the system face frequent partitions (global scale)?

🧠 Examples by System Type
System	Priority	Notes
Banking system	CP	Inconsistent balances are unacceptable
Instagram comments	AP	Delay in seeing your comment is fine
Multiplayer game leaderboard	CP	Must reflect exact scoring in real-time
News website’s like count	AP	It’s okay if numbers are a little behind
Collaborative document editor	CP	All clients must see latest content

🧰 Engineering Tactics to Manage CAP
For AP systems:

Use eventual consistency, retries, background syncs

Design for idempotency in requests

For CP systems:

Use strongly consistent databases (e.g., RDBMS, Spanner)

Implement timeouts and retries for availability fallback

✅ Summary Table
System Needs	Choose	Example
Accuracy > Availability	CP	Banking, Order Processing
Speed > Accuracy	AP	Feed, Metrics, Likes
Network-resilient only	CA (only in theory)	Rare (single-node systems)

🏁 Final Thought
“CAP isn’t a restriction—it’s a guide. It helps you decide what to sacrifice when things go wrong.”

Every system fails at some point. CAP helps you plan for that failure in a controlled and predictable way.
