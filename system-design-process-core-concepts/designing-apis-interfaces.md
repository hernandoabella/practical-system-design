Designing APIs & Interfaces
“In modern systems, your API is your product.”

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) define how different parts of a system interact. Whether you're designing microservices, mobile apps, or public SDKs, clean API and interface design is critical for usability, scalability, and evolution.

🔑 Why API Design Matters
Enables communication between components and systems

Drives frontend-backend integration

Supports scalability (stateless, cacheable, idempotent)

Directly affects developer experience (DX) and adoption

Impacts versioning, backward compatibility, and debugging

🎯 Key Design Principles
1. Clear Resource Modeling
Use RESTful principles or GraphQL only when appropriate:

Think in nouns, not verbs: /users, /orders

Use correct HTTP methods:

GET /posts: list

POST /posts: create

PUT /posts/:id: update

DELETE /posts/:id: remove

2. Statelessness
Each request must contain all the context needed to process it.

Stateless APIs help horizontal scalability and caching.

3. Idempotency
Same request → same result.

Ensure PUT/DELETE requests are idempotent (repeatable without side effects).

4. Versioning
Use URL-based or header-based versioning.

/api/v1/users (preferred)

Accept: application/vnd.api+json; version=2.0

5. Standardized Responses
json
Copiar
Editar
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Alice"
  },
  "error": null
}
Keep success and error formats consistent.

Use meaningful HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 500, etc.).

6. Rate Limiting & Throttling
Add headers to communicate limits:

yaml
Copiar
Editar
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 742
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1699999020
🔄 REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC
Protocol	Use Case	Notes
REST	General-purpose APIs	Simpler, widely adopted
GraphQL	Dynamic, frontend-driven queries	Avoid for large-scale write operations
gRPC	Low-latency, microservice-to-microservice RPC	Great for internal high-performance systems

🛠 Interface Design Patterns
Pattern	Example	Use Case
Resource-based	GET /users/123/orders	REST standard
Action-based	POST /users/123/activate	Mutating with verbs
Batch APIs	POST /orders/batch	Reduce overhead from multiple calls
Webhook	POST /events from external systems	Notification-based interactions
Pagination	GET /items?page=2&limit=20	Load partial data efficiently
Filtering	GET /users?role=admin&active=true	Dynamic querying

📏 API Metrics to Monitor
Latency per endpoint

Error rate (4xx, 5xx)

Throughput (RPS/QPS)

Cache hit ratio (if using CDN)

Version usage (to track legacy endpoints)

📦 Sample API Design: Notes Service
🔹 Endpoint Summary
Operation	Method	Path
List Notes	GET	/api/v1/notes
Create Note	POST	/api/v1/notes
Retrieve Note	GET	/api/v1/notes/:id
Update Note	PUT	/api/v1/notes/:id
Delete Note	DELETE	/api/v1/notes/:id

🔹 Response Example
json
Copiar
Editar
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": 17,
    "title": "System Design Notes",
    "tags": ["backend", "api"],
    "created_at": "2025-07-19T10:00:00Z"
  }
}

🚀 Final Thought
“APIs are forever. Design them with care.”

Whether you're building internal services or public developer platforms, clean APIs ensure system longevity and low-friction collaboration.
