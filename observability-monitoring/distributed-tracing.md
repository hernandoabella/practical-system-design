Distributed Tracing: Jaeger & Zipkin
In microservices architecture, a single request may pass through dozens of services. Distributed tracing lets you visualize, analyze, and debug this end-to-end journey.

✅ Why Distributed Tracing?
Tracks the lifecycle of a request across services

Identifies slow hops, failures, and bottlenecks

Essential for performance monitoring and debugging

Complements metrics and logs in a modern observability stack

🔍 Key Concepts
Concept	Description
Trace	A full journey of a request from start to finish across systems
Span	A single unit of work (e.g., DB call, API call) within a trace
Context	Metadata passed along services to track the trace (e.g., trace ID, span ID)
Parent/Child Span	Nesting of spans to represent call hierarchy

📘 Example Trace (E-commerce API)
plaintext
Copiar
Editar
Trace ID: 789xyz

→ Web API (span: 200ms)
    → Auth Service (50ms)
    → Product Service (90ms)
        → DB Query (40ms)
    → Payment Gateway (60ms)
This trace shows where most time is spent — helpful for optimization.

📦 Distributed Tracing Stack
Jaeger
CNCF project, part of OpenTelemetry ecosystem

Offers storage, UI, sampling, and visualization

Integrates with gRPC, HTTP, Kafka, etc.

Zipkin
Lightweight and fast

Easy to deploy and use

Works well for simple tracing setups

🛠️ OpenTelemetry: The Bridge
OpenTelemetry is the standard for instrumenting traces, logs, and metrics.

You instrument your app using OpenTelemetry SDK, which exports traces to Jaeger/Zipkin.

Sample (Python Flask + OpenTelemetry + Jaeger)
python
Copiar
Editar
from flask import Flask
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.exporter.jaeger.thrift import JaegerExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider

app = Flask(__name__)
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)

tracer_provider = TracerProvider()
jaeger_exporter = JaegerExporter(agent_host_name='localhost', agent_port=6831)

# Configure exporter
📊 Jaeger vs Zipkin
Feature	Jaeger	Zipkin
UI	Powerful search, dependencies	Simple & clean
Scalability	High (production-grade)	Lightweight
Storage Options	Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Kafka	MySQL, Elasticsearch
OpenTelemetry Ready	✅ Full support	✅ Full support
Ideal For	Large systems, complex tracing	Lightweight tracing

🔄 Integration with Logs & Metrics
Use trace ID in logs and metrics to correlate

Combine with:

Prometheus for metrics

Grafana for dashboards

Loki/ELK for logs

🔐 Security & Performance Tips
Avoid tracing every request (sampling)

Don’t log sensitive data in spans

Use filters for high-cardinality labels

Offload trace ingestion to async collectors

💬 Interview Soundbite
“For tracing requests across services, I’d use OpenTelemetry to instrument spans and export to Jaeger. This helps identify slow services or DB calls in a trace. I’d integrate trace IDs into logs for full visibility and use sampling to reduce overhead.”

🧠 Use Cases
Scenario	Value
Debug slow checkout in e-commerce	See where the latency occurs
View dependency tree of services	Understand system topology
Track a failing request through stack	Root-cause diagnosis
Analyze performance regressions	Compare spans before/after code
