Metrics Collection: Prometheus + Grafana
In modern system design, observability is as critical as scalability. Prometheus and Grafana are two industry-standard tools that enable teams to monitor, alert, and visualize the internal state of services.

✅ Functional Requirements
Collect metrics from applications and services

Store metrics over time for querying and analysis

Define alert rules (e.g., high CPU usage, slow response)

Visualize metrics with rich dashboards

Support multi-service monitoring in distributed systems

📦 Key Tools
Tool	Purpose
Prometheus	Time-series database + metrics scraper
Grafana	Dashboard and alerting platform
Exporters	Translate system/app metrics into Prometheus format

🧪 What Are Metrics?
Metrics are numeric values describing aspects of a system over time.

Type	Examples
Counter	Requests served, errors occurred
Gauge	CPU usage, memory usage, temp
Histogram	Response time buckets
Summary	Quantiles over response times

📊 Common Use Cases
Use Case	Metric Example
Track request load	http_requests_total
Measure response latency	http_request_duration_seconds
Monitor memory usage	process_resident_memory_bytes
Alert on service downtime	up == 0
Monitor queue length	queue_size

⚙️ Prometheus Configuration
yaml
Copiar
Editar
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']
  - job_name: 'myapp'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
Each target must expose a /metrics endpoint in Prometheus exposition format.

🔧 Application Integration
Your app should expose metrics at /metrics.

Example (Python Flask + Prometheus client):

python
Copiar
Editar
from prometheus_client import Counter, start_http_server

REQUEST_COUNT = Counter("http_requests_total", "Total Requests")

@app.route("/")
def index():
    REQUEST_COUNT.inc()
    return "Hello World!"
📉 Grafana Dashboards
Grafana queries Prometheus with PromQL, a powerful query language.

Examples:

Requests per second:

promql
Copiar
Editar
rate(http_requests_total[1m])
Memory usage:

promql
Copiar
Editar
process_resident_memory_bytes
Average response time:

promql
Copiar
Editar
rate(http_request_duration_seconds_sum[1m]) /
rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[1m])
📢 Alerts with Prometheus + Grafana
Define alerts in Prometheus or Grafana:

yaml
Copiar
Editar
groups:
- name: app_alerts
  rules:
  - alert: HighLatency
    expr: rate(http_request_duration_seconds_sum[1m]) > 0.5
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "High request latency detected"
You can send alerts to Slack, PagerDuty, Email, etc.

📌 Key Design Considerations
Concern	Strategy
High cardinality	Avoid overly granular labels
Storage optimization	Retention policies, downsampling
Scaling Prometheus	Federation or remote storage integrations
Reliability	Replicas, alert on gaps in scraping

🔐 Security Practices
Protect Prometheus and Grafana endpoints with auth

Don’t expose internal metrics to public internet

Scrub sensitive data from labels (e.g., IPs, tokens)

💬 Interview Soundbite
“I’d use Prometheus to scrape metrics from microservices and system exporters. Grafana would provide dashboards and alerting. Metrics like latency, CPU, and error rates help us react before users are impacted. To reduce cardinality, I’d design labels carefully and use recording rules for aggregation.”
