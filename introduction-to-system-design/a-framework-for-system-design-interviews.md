## A Framework for System Design Interviews

“You don’t need to memorize answers. You need to show how you think.”

System design interviews are open-ended, ambiguous, and often intimidating. The good news? With the right framework, you can approach any system design question with confidence.

🎯 What Interviewers Are Really Looking For
Before diving into the framework, understand what you’re being evaluated on:

Structured thinking – Can you break down a complex system into manageable parts?

Tradeoff awareness – Do you understand the implications of your decisions?

Communication – Can you clearly explain what you're building and why?

Adaptability – Can you handle changing or vague requirements?

Technical depth – Can you go deep when needed (DB, cache, API, etc.)?

🧭 The 4-Step System Design Interview Framework
Use this as a mental checklist during any design question.

🟢 1. Clarify the Requirements
“Don’t start designing. Start asking.”

Questions to ask:
What is the main goal of the system?

Who are the users? What’s the usage pattern?

What are the core features? (Scope control!)

Are there any non-functional requirements? (Latency, uptime, consistency)

Are there any constraints or must-use tools?

📌 Example Prompt: “Design a URL shortener”
Clarify:

Should the links expire?

Are analytics needed?

Is custom aliasing allowed?

🟡 2. High-Level Design
“Paint the big picture before diving into details.”

Sketch a top-down architecture:

Clients (web, mobile)

API layer or Gateway

Services and microservices

Caching and databases

Load balancers, queues, CDN

External systems (payment, notifications, etc.)

🛠 Tools to mention:

REST vs gRPC

SQL vs NoSQL

Redis, Kafka, S3, CDN, Load Balancer, API Gateway

🎯 Focus on:

Component interaction

Data flow

Latency-sensitive paths

🟠 3. Deep Dive into Key Components
“Pick 2–3 critical parts and show your technical depth.”

Common deep-dive areas:

Database schema and partitioning strategy

Caching strategy: What to cache? How to invalidate?

Rate limiting and abuse prevention

Messaging queues and async flows

API design with versioning and throttling

Security: JWT, OAuth2, encryption, permissions

Data model: Relational? Key-value? Graph?

📌 Pro tip: Say why you chose that design and what you’d change under extreme scale.

🔴 4. Address Bottlenecks, Scaling & Tradeoffs
“Every system breaks. Where does yours?”

Discuss potential issues:

What’s the first bottleneck under heavy load?

What are the failure points and fallback plans?

Would you scale vertically or horizontally?

How does the system evolve from MVP to 10M users?

Mention tradeoffs:

Consistency vs Availability

Speed vs Cost

Complexity vs Maintainability

🧠 Tip: Use CAP theorem, data durability, and caching layers to frame your tradeoffs.

📌 Bonus Step: Iterate When Prompted
Interviewers might throw a curveball:

“Now add analytics.”

“Support 10x more users.”

“Remove a dependency.”

This tests your adaptability. Stay calm, revisit the framework, and re-architect if needed.

🔁 Framework Summary
Step	Goal
1. Clarify Requirements	Prevent wrong assumptions and scope creep
2. High-Level Design	Map the system's major components and data flow
3. Deep Dive	Show engineering depth where it matters
4. Bottlenecks & Tradeoffs	Prove your design is scalable, fault-tolerant, and well-reasoned

✅ Example Prompt Run-Through
🧪 Prompt: "Design a Messaging App (like WhatsApp)"

Clarify: Group messages? Read receipts? Multimedia?

High-level: Client → API → Chat service → DB/Cache + Queue

Deep dives: Data schema, real-time delivery, message ordering

Bottlenecks: Message fanout, mobile offline sync, scale to millions

🏁 Final Thought
You don’t need to get it perfect. You need to think out loud, justify your decisions, and show awareness of system constraints.

“Interviewers don’t want to see the right system. They want to see your system—and how you reasoned your way there.”
