# Interview vs Real-World Design
System design is a core part of both technical interviews and day-to-day engineering work. But the expectations, constraints, and goals differ significantly between the two. Knowing these differences helps you tailor your approach depending on the situation, whether you're whiteboarding in front of an interviewer or building systems in production.

## The Interview Setting
System design interviews compress years of engineering into 30–60 minutes. They don’t expect perfect solutions, but rather:
- Clear communication
- Structured thinking
- High-level architecture
- Informed tradeoffs
- Adaptability when requirements change

Interviewers are assessing your ability to handle ambiguity, break down large problems, and prioritize under time constraints.

## You’ll often work on problems like:
- Designing Twitter's feed or a chat app
- Creating a scalable URL shortener
- Handling traffic spikes or 1M RPS APIs

## The interviewer wants to know:
- Can you reason through complexity with limited time and no code?

## The Real-World Setting
In production systems, You need to:

- Balance tradeoffs over time
- Work across teams and departments
- Design for change and failure
- Ensure scalability, observability, and maintainability
- Build for unknown future growth

> You’re not just diagramming a system—you’re deploying, monitoring, evolving, and fixing it.

### Examples of real-world challenges:
- Migrating a monolith to microservices with zero downtime
- Meeting SLAs across multiple regions
- Rolling out authentication that complies with GDPR and SOC2
- Recovering from a cascading failure during peak traffic
### Real-world design requires you to ask:
- Can this system evolve, recover, and deliver value in production?

### Final Thought
A great engineer can navigate both worlds:
- Speak the language of interviews
- Ship the systems that last
