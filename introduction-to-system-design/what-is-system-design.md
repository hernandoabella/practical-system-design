# What is System Design?
System Design is the process of planning the architecture, components, data flow, and infrastructure of a system to meet specific goals. Think of it as the blueprint for building software systems that are scalable, reliable, and maintainable.

## Real-World Examples of System Design Questions
- How would you design a URL Shortener like bit.ly?
- How would you store and stream videos like Netflix?
- How would you build a rate limiter to protect your API?
- How would you store billions of photos?

## What Is a "System"?
A system is a collection of:

> A PERFECT system doesn’t exist. Design is about trade-offs.

## Key Takeaways
- System Design is about architecting solutions that scale and perform.
- It’s less about code, more about trade-offs, architecture, and infrastructure.
- It’s essential for interviews, high-scale systems, and leadership roles.
- Every system has different needs—there’s no single “right” design, only appropriate trade-offs.
