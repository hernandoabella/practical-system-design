## 4-Step Framework for Solving Any System Design Interview Question
“Structure beats spontaneity—every time.”

System design interviews are intentionally ambiguous. This framework gives you a repeatable, proven approach to handle any question with confidence and clarity—even if you’ve never seen the problem before.

🧭 Why Use a Framework?
Without structure, candidates often:

Jump into components too early

Forget important requirements

Get lost in technical details

Fail to highlight tradeoffs

A good framework helps you stay focused, prioritize, and communicate effectively.

✅ The 4 Steps
1️⃣ Step 1: Clarify Requirements
“A wrong design begins with wrong assumptions.”

Your goal: Understand what you're really being asked to design. Interviews often start vague on purpose—your job is to ask clarifying questions.

🔍 What to clarify:
Functional features: What should it do?

Non-functional goals: Latency, availability, consistency?

Constraints: Specific tech, budget, scale?

Assumptions: Mobile/web clients? Auth required? SLA?

🧠 Example Questions:
Should users be able to delete or edit posts?

Do we need support for file uploads?

Are analytics or real-time metrics required?

2️⃣ Step 2: Outline the High-Level Architecture
“Draw the box-and-lines version of your system.”

Your goal: Identify the key components and how they interact.

💡 Focus on:
Client layer (web/mobile)

APIs or gateway layer

Core services or microservices

Caching layers

Database/storage systems

External dependencies (e.g., payment, auth)

Optional: CDN, load balancers, monitoring

📌 Keep it simple, but complete. This is your system’s skeleton.

3️⃣ Step 3: Deep Dive Into Core Components
“Zoom in on the most interesting or challenging parts.”

Your goal: Show your depth of knowledge.

🎯 Pick 2–3 key areas depending on the system. Could include:

Database schema and scaling (sharding, replication)

Caching strategy (what, where, how long)

Rate limiting & abuse protection

Queuing and async processing

File storage & CDN design

Security and auth flow

Realtime components (WebSockets, long-polling)

🧠 Always explain why you're doing it this way and the tradeoffs involved.

4️⃣ Step 4: Discuss Bottlenecks, Tradeoffs & Scale
“Stress test your design.”

Your goal: Show that you’ve thought about:

What breaks under load?

How to scale to 10x more users?

What happens on failure?

Which parts can be improved over time?

📈 Talk through:

Vertical vs horizontal scaling

Caching invalidation strategies

Tradeoffs between consistency, latency, availability

Monitoring, logging, and alerting plans

🧠 Be honest: no system is perfect. Tradeoffs are real. Show you know them.

🔄 Recap Table
Step	What You're Doing	Why It Matters
1	Clarify Requirements	Avoid wrong assumptions and scope creep
2	Design High-Level Architecture	Communicate your thinking clearly
3	Deep Dive into Key Components	Demonstrate technical competence
4	Address Bottlenecks & Tradeoffs	Prove your design is scalable and robust

🧪 Sample Usage
Prompt: “Design Instagram Stories”

Step 1 – Clarify: Expiration? Notifications? Privacy controls?
Step 2 – Architecture: Client → API → Story service → DB/CDN → Notification queue
Step 3 – Deep dives: Story storage (S3 + CDN), story expiration with TTL/cache, user feed generation
Step 4 – Bottlenecks: Content fanout, CDN cache misses, offline viewing

🏁 Final Advice
Speak while thinking. Interviews aren't silent exams.

Use whiteboarding or visuals. Don’t keep ideas in your head.

Start simple, then iterate. MVP first, scale second.

Practice 10–15 problems with this framework until it’s second nature.

“Think like an architect. Communicate like a teacher.”
