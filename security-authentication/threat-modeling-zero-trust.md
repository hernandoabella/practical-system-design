Threat Modeling & Zero Trust Security
‚ÄúAssume breach. Verify explicitly. Enforce least privilege.‚Äù

Designing secure systems requires two essential approaches: Threat Modeling to identify and mitigate risks, and Zero Trust Architecture to enforce security at every layer ‚Äî not just the perimeter.

üß† What Is Threat Modeling?
Threat modeling is a structured approach to identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential security threats in your application or system design.

üéØ When to Use It
During system design and architecture planning

Before launching a new feature or product

As part of security reviews

üõ†Ô∏è Threat Modeling Process
Step	Description
1. Identify Assets	What are you protecting? (e.g., user data, tokens)
2. Diagram the System	Use DFDs, sequence diagrams, architecture sketches
3. Identify Threats	Use frameworks like STRIDE or DREAD
4. Prioritize Risks	Based on impact and likelihood
5. Mitigate	Design controls (e.g., input validation, logging)

üîç Common Threats via STRIDE
Threat	Description	Example
Spoofing	Pretending to be someone else	Fake login requests
Tampering	Modifying data	Malicious DB injection
Repudiation	Denying actions without logging	No audit trail of actions
Information Disclosure	Leaking sensitive data	Unencrypted PII
Denial of Service	Crashing the system	Bot floods API with requests
Elevation of Privilege	Gaining unauthorized access levels	Normal user gets admin rights

|   Client   | <-----> |  API Gateway   | <-----> |  Auth Service  |
+------------+         +----------------+         +----------------+

Assets: Credentials, JWT tokens, User sessions  
Threats:
- Brute-force login attacks (S)
- Token theft (I)
- SQL Injection in login form (T)
- Missing logs for login failures (R)
Mitigations:
- Rate limiting, CAPTCHA
- Encrypt tokens at rest/in transit
- Use parameterized queries
- Centralized logging & alerts
üß± What Is Zero Trust Security?
Zero Trust means ‚ÄúNever trust, always verify.‚Äù
No user, device, or service is trusted ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs inside your network.

üîí Zero Trust Core Principles
Principle	Description
Verify Explicitly	Authenticate every request using strong ID checks
Least Privilege Access	Users/services get only what they need
Assume Breach	Design as if attackers are already inside
Micro-Segmentation	Isolate workloads and restrict lateral movement
Continuous Monitoring	Monitor behavior, apply adaptive policies

  | Enforced Policies    | (RBAC, ABAC, Network rules)

  All access must be authorized, encrypted, and logged
üîß How to Implement Zero Trust in Practice
Area	Zero Trust Practice
AuthN / AuthZ	OAuth2, JWT, SSO, MFA
Network	Mutual TLS, microsegmentation, service mesh
Infrastructure	IAM roles, fine-grained policies, SCPs
Logging	Full observability and audit logging
Devices	Device posture checks, endpoint management

‚úÖ Summary Table
Aspect	Threat Modeling	Zero Trust
Purpose	Identify & mitigate threats	Continuously verify trust
Focus	What could go wrong	What to restrict & secure by default
Tools	STRIDE, DFDs, DREAD	IAM, service mesh, policy engines
Key Outcome	Mitigated risks	Minimal trust boundaries + active control

üé§ Interview Ready Soundbite
‚ÄúI practice threat modeling using STRIDE at the design stage and follow Zero Trust principles in production: no implicit trust, strong authentication, and microsegmentation between services.‚Äù
