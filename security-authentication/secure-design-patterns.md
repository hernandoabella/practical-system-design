Secure Design Patterns in System Architecture
"Security should be baked in, not bolted on."

Secure design patterns are repeatable solutions to common security issues that help ensure your system is resilient, auditable, and hard to exploit.

📦 Why Use Secure Design Patterns?
Reduce vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, injection)

Ensure consistency across teams and services

Improve compliance posture (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

Help systems scale securely

🔐 Key Secure Design Patterns
1. Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)
Each component, user, or service should have only the minimum access necessary to perform its role.

✅ Apply To	Examples
IAM Policies	Allow read-only access to logs
DB Roles	App user can't DROP TABLE
Microservices	Can’t talk to unrelated services

2. Defense in Depth
Layer multiple security mechanisms so if one fails, others still protect the system.

Client → TLS → API Gateway → Auth Middleware → App Server → DB ACLs → Logging
Each layer guards against a different threat vector.

3. Fail Securely
Ensure systems fail in a secure state, not an open one.

Insecure	Secure
Login failure → Grant access	Login failure → Deny access
Rate limiter error → Allow all	Error → Deny requests temporarily

4. Secure Defaults
Use secure-by-default configurations out of the box.

Examples:

HTTPS enabled

Strong password requirements

Disable verbose error messages in prod

TLS 1.3 by default

5. Input Validation & Output Encoding
Never trust input. Always sanitize and encode.

Threat	Defense
SQL Injection	Parameterized queries (e.g., ORM)
XSS	Output encoding (HTML escaping)
CSRF	CSRF tokens + SameSite cookies

6. Use Strong Authentication & Authorization
Enforce MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

Prefer OAuth2 + OpenID Connect for federated login

Role-based or Attribute-based access control (RBAC / ABAC)

7. Secure Logging & Auditing
Logs must be tamper-proof, redact sensitive info, and be audit-friendly.

Best Practices:

Hash PII or redact in logs

Use centralized logging (e.g., ELK, Loki)

Alert on unusual activity

8. Rate Limiting & API Throttling
Prevent brute-force, scraping, and DDoS.

Use token buckets or leaky bucket algorithms

Apply limits per IP, per user, or per API key

Return 429 Too Many Requests

9. Zero Trust Architecture
Trust nothing by default, even inside the network.

Mutual TLS between services

Strict identity & policy enforcement

Assume breach posture

10. Immutable Infrastructure & IaC
Infrastructure should be re-deployed, not modified.

Use Terraform / Pulumi

No SSH into servers

Version control infrastructure

🧠 Security-Ready Interview Soundbites
“I use defense-in-depth — from TLS at the edge to RBAC at the application level.”

“All input is validated at the boundary, and all sensitive logs are redacted before writing to our observability stack.”

“We enforce least privilege using scoped API tokens and encrypted secrets via a KMS.”

✅ Summary Table
Pattern	Purpose
Least Privilege	Minimize access scope
Defense in Depth	Layered security
Fail Securely	Secure fallback mechanisms
Secure Defaults	Safe out-of-box settings
Input Validation	Prevent code injection
Strong Auth/AuthZ	Prevent unauthorized access
Secure Logging	Traceable + sensitive-data aware
Rate Limiting	Prevent abuse
Zero Trust	No implicit trust
Immutable Infra / IaC	Safe, reproducible environments
